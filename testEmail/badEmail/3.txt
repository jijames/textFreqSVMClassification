DONATION FOR YOU
 
May the peace of God be with you and your family.
 
I know it will be a great surprise reading from me today but consider this a divine intervention as a pastor explained to my understanding. My name is Mrs. Teresa Stang, a widow from Oklahoma USA and am writing you from my sickbed because i have been fighting cancer.
 
I will tell you more about myself and what you need to do with the money once your receive it. Please write me soon as my health is pretty bad and my doctors says i will be moved to the intensive care unit anytime soon.
 
Have a blessed day and please do pray for me.
 
God bless you.
Mother Teresa Stang.
