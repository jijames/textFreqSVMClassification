 Attention: Beneficiary,

This is to bring to your notice that because of the impossibility of your
fund transfer through our western union network, we have credited your
total fund of $4,800,000.00 Legitimate USD into an ATM VISA card, and we
have paid the delivery fee of your ATM VISA card to you, we paid it
because your ATM VISA card worth of $4,800,000.00 which we have registered
for deliver, has less than 16 days to expire in the custody of the DHL
Company and when it expires, the money will go into federal government
treasury account.

For that we decided to help you pay off the money so that your ATM VISA
card will not expire, because we trust that when you receive this your ATM
VISA card, definitely you must pay us back and even compensate us for
helping you. Like we stated earlier, the delivery charges has been paid
therefore the only money you were advice to send to them is their official
security keeping fees of $45usd every day.

Like I stated earlier, the crediting re-activation, delivery and the
company registration charges has been paid by me, but I did not pay their
official security keeping fees since they refused, they refused and the
reason is that they do not know when you are going to contact them and the
demurrage might have increased by then, They told me that their official
security keeping fees is $45.00 per a day , and I deposited it yesterday
being 22 of November 2016.
