This is John from the space meetup.  Count me in for a talk or series of talks, depending on how things unroll, to be titled "Hacking into Orbit" with a focus on the leadership role that software engineers can take in pushing "hard tech" forward, with space travel as the demonstrative problem.

To that end, I will be gathering up more recent information about what software is used in practice.  I also have a small network into private aerospace companies that I will poll about what their grievances, experience, and outlook.  

I would guess that NASA has all of the same experiences and less trade-secret restriction, but that can go both ways being in a public agency that also has national security concerns.  If you know anyone interested in the discussion, I'm definitely interested in getting their knowledge into the stew.

Slotting something for February seems safe.
