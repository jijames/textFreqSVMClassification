Had a conversation with Dan Walker, V.P. of Development for the Rocky 
Mountain Elk Foundation concerning Enron's future as a partner.  Dan will be 
meeting with the CEO of the Foundation to pursue actions towards an Agreement 
or MOU between Enron and the RMEF.  Interest has been surprisingly high for 
employees within and without GPG expressing a desire to be involved with the 
Foundation.  

Assisted C/S No. 8, Corona with the development and submittal of the 
facility's Title V semi annual report and annual compliance certification 
report submittals.
